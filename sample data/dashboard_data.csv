Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

I found it very tart, but not overly fruity.  Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.<br /><br />Other reviews also mention a floral smell when brewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off-putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip-lock bag, like some of their other teas.

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

There is no need to use a whole pill pocket for a pill or capsule if the capsule or pill is small... just use enough pill pocket to cover the pill/capsule and fool your pet.  For instance, we tear each pill pocket in half and wrap that half around the dog's medication.  By the way, the size listed on the Pill Pocket bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog.

I had tried a myriad of kitty litters prior to settling on Feline Pine.  Since one was a kitten and both came from a shelter, I don't think the cats were particularly picky about their litter.  I switched them from clay to pine pellets without using any transition and they were unphased.<br /><br />After using Feline Pine for a few weeks, I decided to go ahead and buy two of the litter boxes made for the litter.  Having the ability to sift out the sawdust (which is created when cat urine breaks down the pine pellets) into the bottom pan has made litter box cleanup SUPER easy!<br /><br />This is what I do:  1.  Scoop solids once per day and shake the box side to side in the evening to move any sawdust that the cats didn't scratch down into the bottom pan.  2.  Empty the bottom pan about one time per week by dumping into a 5-gallon bucket with lid.  3.  Place a few of the slightly broken down pellets (those that have been in the litter box for a week) into the bottom pan.  This keeps the sawdust from sticking to the bottom pan and makes dumping easier.  4.  Add some fresh pellets to top tray if it looks too shallow.  I do this when dumping bottom tray. 5.  Completely empty the top tray about one time per month.  Place some old pellets in bottom tray as stated above.<br /><br />You can apparently use the sawdust as compost.  I prefer to get rid of it by dumping the 5-gallon bucket into a trashbag when full.  Then again, I also have dogs and I worry they would get into the compost.  Another note - a 20-25lb. bag lasted me about a month (with a little left over) and that took care of two litter boxes.<br /><br />My final suggestion ... and this has been mentioned before ...  if you have a local farm store such as a Tractor Supply Company, look for Equine Pine which is horse bedding.  It is the same thing, but costs FAR less.  Up until recently, I was buying Feline Pine at $9-11 for a 20-25lb. bag.  I found Equine Pine for about $6.50 for a 40lb. bag.  MUCH CHEAPER!",2

This was NOT a good thing...  So much for being creative and resourceful...<br /><br />I finally bit my humble bullet and returned to my good and faithful Feline Pine Litter.  Yes, there is a little tracking (very little) and it's no fun when you unexpectedly step on a piece of pine.  Ouch!  On the other hand, Feline Pine does absorb the urine and hide the odor quite well. I also like the idea that it's a natural product and that it's not full of chemicals or skin irritants that can harm my cat.<br /><br />Here's some frugal advice...  If your kitty pees in the same spot in the litter box like mine does, just scoop out the wet litter from that spot and add new litter to fill the now vacant space in your box.  Voila!  Your kitty box will be smelling fresh and piney once again.  You will also use less litter and have more money to spend on cat treats and toys (the fun stuff,) instead!",2

I switched to ""World's Best"" litter and he likes it much better and doesn't go to inappropriate locations anymore.

These pellets really absorbs urine oder, but you do need to scoop out the solid waste a little more frequently since they have difficulty burying it.  Tracking is very minimal.  The fact that no strip mining (like for clay litter) and no offensive perfumes means that it's a little more environmentally friendly than many commercial litters.

The odor goes away within a few minutes, and I just scoop out feces at the end of the day.<br />2. It is very inexpensive. You only fill the box a small amount, unlike clay litters. I use it along with the Feline Pine Self cleaning litter box, and this is the best value. I only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a YEAR.<br />3.

I almost want to laugh when I go to people's houses and I see their disgusting clay litter boxes, or see people buying clay litter at the store.

I purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them, but she ok with the Feline Pine pellets.<br /><br />To those who are saying FP is a ""poor value"" because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same, first of all I have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same.

Needless to say, things were cramped, and my cat was sadly confined to just this small room. Having a litter box 3' from your bed requires the absolute BEST in odor control.<br /><br />I tried EVERYTHING. Clay, crystals, clay WITH crystals, etc.. And came upon Feline Pine. I was very eager to try it since it's natural. Well, I've never gone back to any other brand! (And we aren't even living in that tiny room anymore..)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Poop smell. This is NOT neutralized very effectively by the pine pellets. If your cat buries his/her business, you are in slightly better luck. My cat often doesn't, which I've found generally happens when I've just put fresh pellets in. However, for myself the poop smell is a blessing in disguise. It keeps me up on the chore of the litter box, which was easily forgotten the time I tried out one of those ""private room"" litter boxes (out of sight, out of mind - I promptly forgot all about taking care of things until my lovely kitty decided to remind me by moving her ""operations"" to the living room floor.. My fault).<br /><br />2) Pellets are too easy to scoop up when removing poop. Using a conventional scooper, I often lose a couple of pellets down the toilet when scooping. I believe Feline Pine sells a scoop made specially for their pellets though - something to try (I haven't).<br /><br />3) Pine dust tracking. Like any litter, the pine dust tracks out and my bathroom floor needs sweeping every other day or so. It doesn't seem to track much more than other litter types, however.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) NO cat urine smell. I couldn't believe it! So long as you replace the pine pellets once they are all saturated, there is NO smell. With one indoor cat, I find that I need to completely replace the 1-2"" of litter once a week.<br /><br />2) No scooping out urine clumps. Damp sawdust needn't be removed - just stirred around so it can air dry (and no biggie, since it doesn't smell!)<br /><br />3) Natural. My cat used to sneeze and cough from clay litters, and the crystal litters reek of chemicals. Not to mention chemical fragrances. Cats lick themselves to bathe - would you rather your cat licks off chemicals, or pine dust?<br /><br />4) Poop smell. Yeah - for me, this is actually a pro.

Additionally, when cleaning out the urine-soaked sawdust, I feel like I'm going to pass out from the strong ammonia smell.

I have a strong aversion to cat box smell in any house and don't like keeping a litter box, but with a new kitten who's not allowed outside, it is necessary. This litter is not only non-toxic for cats and humans, it neutralizes odor and can be composted under trees and shrubs when it is used up. We use the litter according to directions - covering the bottom of the box with one inch of litter, scoop poop as soon as we discover it (usually 2x/day), and only need to change the box once every 7-10 days when all of the pine pellets have turned to pee-soaked sawdust.

I just adopted a new cat and her two kittens after my final 15-year-old clay-using cat passed away.

Sold, ok, I can transition them to clay, right?<br /><br />No thanks! I love these pellets. My cats don't track them out like some people's, though, and that helps. I feel like clay is MUCH messier. Here is the technique I've developed. One inch in the bottom of the pan (which scared me when the adoption lady told me that, it seemed like way too little!) and I scoop daily. First, scoop the poop out. Then I use a dust pan, like for sweeping the floor to move half the litter aside and sift the litter using a ""traditional"" clay litter scooper. The sawdust sifts into a pile, and I put the pellets in another pile. It doesn't take that long because there is only an inch of litter in. Then I scoop out the sawdust using the dust pan, which I only use for the litter box, and it goes into the compost. Sprinkle on fresh pellets and I am done.<br /><br />I should note that I use a very wide shallow pan (it was meant for an underbed storage drawer) since my previous elderly cat got so creaky she had trouble making it into a normal litter box.

Clay litter obviously is maybe 1/8 inch round, so it sticks to poop.  These are kind of glossy.<br /><br />So bottom line is if you use this as a litter by itself, you're kind of dumb for even trying to do that with pellets like that.<br /><br />However, if you mix it in with clay litter and baking soda, it absorbs odor like you wouldn't believe.

The smells are quite mitigated and you don't get new bugs as you could with the cornmeal-based ones. Clumping can lodge itself to the litter box and scrapping that can be a pain. This ships on a schedule for our two cats and with their old point system, got a free scoop. The cats come out with clean paws, unlike the clay-based litters - we'd find litter, literally, all over the house, on sofas and chairs, on the bed, wherever they roamed.<br /><br />One draw back though is how you want to deal with the broken down litter, since it becomes soft and builds up in the box. You can throw it all out but there's still a good mix of ""unused"" litter pellets. So with more effort, the larger scoop can haul out the solid waste and we use the usual litter scoop (smaller holes) and sift through, keeping the pellets.

119823,B0009YUEG2,AF8SREA2XE7BJ,M. Karazim,4,5,4,1290988800,"Good, but........","In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.<br /><br />As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no ""litter box feet"" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.<br /><br />Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to ""rinse"" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.  Gross.<br /><br />Feline Pine, I need a decent box for this litter!",2

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store.

Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older.

They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering.

This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.

I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.
